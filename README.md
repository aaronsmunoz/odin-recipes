Hi there. just learning the in & outs of gitHub.
And well to be quite frank. This programming world is out of this world.
Its March 26, 2022, and hopefully I can make something out of nothing.
Currently i'm learning HTML, CSS, Lots of JavaScript.
But I want to ultimately learn C, I'm suppose to learn it next semester.
Will I? Hopefully, maybe FreeCodeCamp will release a tutorial on it :( lol.
